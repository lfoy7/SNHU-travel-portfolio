## Portfolio Reflection: SNHU Travel Project

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
User stories help translate client needs into actionable development goals. By focusing on what the user wants to achieve (e.g., “Book a Trip”), we were able to break down complex requirements into manageable tasks. This kept the team aligned with customer value and allowed for iterative improvements based on feedback.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development with a focus on collaboration, adaptability, and continuous delivery. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives helped our team stay organized and responsive. I plan to continue using Scrum practices to maintain transparency and improve team efficiency.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating openly, supporting others, and staying accountable. During the SNHU Travel project, our success depended on each person fulfilling their role while helping others overcome challenges. Strong teamwork led to better problem-solving and a more cohesive final product.
